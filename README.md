# Interpretable Machine Learning

- `01_prepare.R`: Data preparation

- `02_modelling.R`: Modelling

- `03_report.Rmd`: R Markdown script with background, descriptions and results.

- `functions.R`: Collection of functions used within the project. Always read via `source` if required.

It suffices to run each script once. Afterwards, they can be run independently in fresh R sessons.
